# Frontend Developer

## Summary 🇺🇦

From the moment I produced "Hello World" in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But software development has never been "just a job" for me, it's offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple "Hello World" has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by.
